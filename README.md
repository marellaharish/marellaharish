# Hi there! 👋

I’m **Harish Marella**, a frontend developer based in India.

I love turning ideas into beautiful, responsive, and performant web and mobile apps. My focus is on **React**, **React Native**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**—with an eye for clean UI and seamless user experience.

I enjoy integrating **AI** into modern apps, and I'm always learning new tools to make development smoother and faster.
